# Search Recipe App

This is a search recipe app that allows users to search for nutritious meals. Application utilizes an API service to
populate the website with recipes. Using the form that contains search bar users can easily query recipes from the API
database and find new interesting recipes to cook.

## UX

### Strategy

- Technical Strategy:
    - I aim to design and build a front-end web application based on the principles of user experience design,
      accessibility and responsivity.
    - I will develop and implement a static front-end web application using HTML, CSS and JS.
    - I will document my code using git tool for better future maintainability.
    - I will deploy the front-end web application using GitHub Pages feature.

- User Strategy:
    - As a user of Search Recipe app, I want to be able to easily search for new recipes without any cognitive overload.
    - As a user of Search Recipe app, I want to be able to view some basic information about recipe without having to
      open a new page.
    - As a user of Search Recipe app, if I am interested in a recipe I want to be able to find out more about the recipe
      by clicking on the recipe associated link.
    - In case of complain or improvement idea I would like to be able to contact the website owner.
    
### Scope plane:

- Recipe API will provide the user with information about recipes that user has search for.
- Search bar in hero section should be easy to use, allowing user to search for new recipes.
- Navigation bar should be easy to use to navigate website interface.
- On page load Recipe API will populate the main content of the website using data and html template tag.
- On search there should be a loader presented before the data is received and rendered.
